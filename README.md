PAH Uncertainty Planning
========================
Algorithms for *planning under uncertainty*. 
Seminar projects for *Planning and game playing* (A4M36PAH) course.

Implemented Algorithms:
-----------------------
- *ReplanAgent* implements basic re-planning that uses Enforced Hill-Climbing 
- *ValueIterationAgent* realizes Value Iteration algorithm for underlying MDP

Creator classes:
----------------
- main classes serving as execution points
- environment and agent setup

Dependencies:
-------------
- trajectorytools (ATG @ FEE CTU)
